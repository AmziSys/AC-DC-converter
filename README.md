------------------ AC to DC Converter ---------------


* This project aims to desgin an 220 VAC to multi-output DC Converter, 24V/12V/6V. (3 outputs)

* The circuit contains:

	- Polyester film capacitor (474J-630V) in parallel with a 97K Ohm resistor
	- Bridge Rectifier 
	- 2 resistors (10 Ohm and 220 Ohm)
	- 3 Zener diodes (24V, 12V, and 6V)

* The design was made using Proteus 8 Pro
